        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, called metadata. Among the metadata tags that can be nested in the head element are the following elements-</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage.</li>
                <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
                <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
                <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
                <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
                <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
              </ul>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. Visible elements we'll be using include the following-</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
                <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
                <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
                <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The src attribute defines the location of the image.</li>
                <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
                <li>the a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
                <li>The section element is a semantic element that defines a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
              </ul>
          <li>An HTML attribute can be put in a beginning element to define additional information about the element.</li>
          <li>Child elements are elements that are nested within other elements, which are called the parent element.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements are elements wherein the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS styles an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>An internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>An external CSS style sheet keeps all CSS rules in a separate file, which is then linked to the HTML file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The CSS box model explains that every HTML element is essentially a box, and each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
          <li>An * selector applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>

          <li>git commit -m "write message here": commits staged files with a message that describes what the commit contains.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls down any changes from the base branch so that the local branch is in sync.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code. Variables may hold values that have different data types:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>String: This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks.</li>
              <li>Number: This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.</li>
              <li>Boolean: This is a True/False value. The words 'true' and 'false' are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li>
              <li>Array: This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
              <li>Object: This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code.</li>
              <li>If you see something which looks like a variable name, but is followed by parentheses— () —it's likely a function.</li>
              <li>Arguments go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>An Operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Addition: Add two numbers together or combine two strings; +</li>
              <li>Subtraction, Multiplication, Division: These do what you'd expect them to do in basic math; -, *, /</li>
              <li>Assignment: This assigns a value to a variable; =</li>
              <li>Strict equality: This performs a test to see if two values are equal. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result; ===</li>
              <li>Not, Does-not-equal: This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false, etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal; !, !==</li>
            </ul>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop.</li>
              <li>The second statement is the condition.</li>
              <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
            </ul>
