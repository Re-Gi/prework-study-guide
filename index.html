        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, called metadata. Among the metadata tags that can be nested in the head element are the following elements-</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage.</li>
                <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
                <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
                <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
                <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
                <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
              </ul>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. Visible elements we'll be using include the following-</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
                <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
                <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
                <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The src attribute defines the location of the image.</li>
                <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
                <li>the a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
                <li>The section element is a semantic element that defines a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
              </ul>
          <li>An HTML attribute can be put in a beginning element to define additional information about the element.</li>
          <li>Child elements are elements that are nested within other elements, which are called the parent element.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements are elements wherein the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS styles an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>An internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>An external CSS style sheet keeps all CSS rules in a separate file, which is then linked to the HTML file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The CSS box model explains that every HTML element is essentially a box, and each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
          <li>An * selector applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
